2.0.7 2001/08/13 joern
	Bugfix:
	- Project Installation: prod replacing of configs was too
	  late. installed html objects did use the original configs,
	  instead of the replaced configs.

2.0.6 2001/08/07 joern
	Features:
	- not only CGI programs can be executed via the object editor,
	  CIPP/HTML pages can be viewed, too.

2.0.5 2001/07/24 joern
	Bugfix:
	- Bugzilla Bug #639
	  dbshell.pl: Tabulator key produces spaces instead of weird
	  command completion (if Term::ReadLine::Perl is used. With
	  Term::ReadLine::Gnu currently Tab keys will be ignored)
	- Bugzilla Bug #835:
	  History viewing did not work on CIPP CGI objects, when the
	  version number exceeded the maximum version number of the
	- "Test CGI" renamed to "Execute CGI"
	- fixed a typo in an "Execute CGI" error message popup window.
	  base configuration object.
	  
	Features:
	- Bugzilla Enhancement #684:
	  new "Java File" object type for files with the extensions:
	  jar, cap, class and properties. These files are handled
	  through a new internal generic Blob handler. It is easy
	  to add new blob file types with this handler.

	- but this generic blob handler is unable to handle
	  files with unknown extensions. For those files a new
	  object type for generic / unknown file types has been added
	  You can upload such files and decide to install them into
	  htdocs, cgi-bin or not to install. CIPP is able to get the URL
	  of such an object.
	
2.0.4_01 2001/05/14 joern
	INTERNAL BETA RELEASE
	Bugfix:
	- Bugzilla Bug #132:
	  CIPP 2.36_01, which fixes some mod_perl issues, is shipped
	  with this release
	- Bugzilla Bug #316:
	  prod/logs is now created for a new project

	Features:
	- Bugzilla Bug #99:
	  Direct execution of CGI programs is now possible. A new entry
	  in the editor window popup appears: "Test CGI". A new window
	  is opened with the URL of the current CIPP CGI program (window
	  position and size can be configured). You can pass parameters
	  through the generic text input field, formatted the standard
	  URL encoded way: 'a=1&b=2'. Thanks go to kurt@dimedis.de for his
	  suggestion.
	- install.pl warns now if the installed CIPP version is older
	  than the shipped version
	- added Artistic and Gnu Public Licenses to the distribution

2.0.3 2001/04/03 joern
	Bugfix:
	- deletion of DB Configuration objects did not work

2.0.2 2001/03/26 joern
	Bugfixes:
	- Project Installation: database config replacing did not
	  work properly

2.0.1 2001/03/23 joern
	Bugfixes:
	- fixed a bug in the bugfix ;)
	  New deterministic meta file format was messed up in some cases

2.0.0 2001/03/23 joern
	Bugfixes:
	- fixed a regex which checks object existence. Due to this bug
	  specifying a replace action object failed under some
	  circumstances
	- Project Installation: "Refresh Base Configs Popup" link was
	  missing, if no base configs are in the base config cache,
	  so recreating the cache was impossible in this case
	- Alternative Base Configurations:
	  Falling back to default project root did not work.
	- format of object property data files is now deterministic,
	  so CVS should not report unnecessary conflicts anymore.
	- meta files of CIPP Config objects were saved unnecessaryly
	  on every access, which caused problems in read only
	  environments
	- login was impossible if the users access right on his last
	  selected project was revoked
	- dbshell.pl: execution of prod/sql scripts was broken.
	  dbshell.pl was unable to find the correspondent database
	  configuration.

	Because there are no significant known bugs on the TODO list:

	WELCOME TO VERSION 2.0.0 :)

1.99.22 2001/03/19 joern
	Bugfixes:
	- SQL execution was completely broken, due to a bug in the
	  command line parser module

1.99.21 2001/03/15 joern
	Bugfixes:
	- Mozilla wrapped long lines of the project tree browser
	- If the last command of a SQL script was not terminated
	  by a semicolon, it was executed infinetely.

	Features:
	- save trigger filter
	  Now you can specify a save filter script for each object.
	  This means: everytime you save the object, this filter
	  script is invoked with the source of the object connected
	  to STDIN. It is possible to pass the full path name of
	  the object file as an argument, using a %s wildcard.
	  Configuration of the save filter script is placed in the
	  properties dialog.
	- Project Installation: #! is implicitely added to the
	  shebang line, if the user did omit it

1.99.20 2001/03/14 joern
	Features:
	- you now can configure an Perl shebang line for project
	  installation in CIPP Base Configuration objects

1.99.19 2001/03/09 joern
	Bugfixes:
	- included actual CIPP version 2.29, which fixes a serious
	  <?!HTTPHEADER> bug (see Changes file of CIPP, for details)
	- user preferences are now applied immediately after saving
	
	Features:
	- New preferences:
	  - Treeview font face/size
	  - Select last opened project by default after login
	- new created projects now have default values in their
	  base configuration (e.g. http header Pragma: no-cache)
	- new created SQL objects now refer to the default
	  database configuration
	- you can limit the maximum size of the object history,
	  by setting an appropriate value in the base configuration
	  (default is 20)
	- Project Compilation "replace object" output reduced.
	- new.spirit now checks for object existence, if you configure
	  a object to be replaced while installation
	- during the installation process your are warned, if an object
	  is replaced more than once

1.99.18 2001/03/07 joern
	Features:
	- included actual CIPP version 2.28
	- added htdocs/doc/index.html for some information about
	  documentation

1.99.17 2001/03/05 joern
	Bugfixes:
	- the CIPP BEGIN block, which sets the library path, was
	  stripped off for syntax checking. So projects, which
	  depend on a additional library path failed in compilation.
	  This version of new.spirit REQUIRES now CIPP version 2.27

1.99.16 2001/03/05 joern
	Bugfixes:
	- "Project Compilation" with dependency truncation did not
	  delete the internal modules hash file. If a module was moved
	  by hand, new.spirit complains about a double module definition,
	  and even a project compilation did not fix this.
	- BEGIN{} and/or END{} blocks were executed during Perl syntnax
	  check, which sometimes makes the system hang.

	Features:
	- you can now define more than one additional perl library search
	  directory by delimiting them with a colon.

1.99.15 2001/02/27 joern
	Bugfixes:
	- the 'use_strict' attribute of CIPP modules was not always
	  correctly initialized (enabled). Now this attribute should
	  always default to 1.
	- error formatting in case of a CIPP/new.spirit module name
	  clashing was messed up

1.99.14 2001/02/19 joern
	Bugfixes:
	- "Project Installation" did not install the prod/lib/
	  directory
	- "Project Installation" did not install the proper
	  default database configuration
	- first installation of a new module did throw an error message
	- creation of image objects did not work
	- project deletion without selection of a project entry was
	  possible
	- object creation using irregular names is prevented now
	- project list is now sorted by project name instead of project
	  description. This fixes also a bug: two projects with the
	  same description were indistinguishable
	- first time creation of a base configuration object causes
	  an exception
	- the NewSpirit::Object class did *always* set a lock on the
	  object, even if this was an internal instantiation, e.g.
	  for a "Project Compilation".

	Features:
	- timestamps of installed files (using "Project Installation")
	  are now set to the source file timestamps. This make
	  rsync's job easier.

1.99.13 2001/02/15 joern
	Bugfix:
	- database connection code of generated modules was broken
	- now new.spirit needs CIPP 2.19 or better, due to the
	  extensions of dynamic database connections (which
	  also fixes the bug stated above)
	
	ATTENTION:
	----------
	You must upgrade your production environments with the
	shipped CIPP 2.19 release, because the CIPP::Runtime did
	change. CGI programs created with this release WILL NOT
	RUN with CIPP versions < 2.19 (resp. CIPP::Runtime < 0.36)


1.99.12 2001/02/14 joern
	Bugfixes:
	- alternative database names did still not work.
	- a htdocs mapping of '/' did produce wrong URLs

	Features:
	- base configuration objects have a new field for
	  a additional perl library directory. So external private
	  libraries can easily be included into your project.

1.99.11 2001/02/13 joern
	Bugfixes:
	- missing Lock Files produce only warnings and no exceptions
	  (this happens, if a project disappears from the filesystem.
	   The thrown exception prevents from selecting another project,
	   so we had a classical deadlock situation ;)
	- creating a project where the project root dir alredy exists,
	  but was not owned by the spirit webserver user, did not work,
	  although if the user has write access
	- dependency processing did sometimes compile too much objects,
	  because transitive dependencies were not filtered enough
	- prod replace function did not work properly

1.99.10 2001/02/12 joern
	Bugfixes:
	- alternative database names did not work

1.99.9 2001/02/11 joern
	Features:
	- bin/convert_cipp-img.pl can execute appropriate cvs
	  commands for you

1.99.8 2001/02/09 joern
	Bugfixes:
	- SQL object database assignment conversion (spirit 1.x ->
	  new.spirit 2.x) did not work
	- usage of Archive::Tar is replaced by a internal new.spirit function
	  for copying directories recursively. This fixes the problelm
	  with Archive::Tar under Windows platforms. Also this is much
	  faster and more reliable than the Archive::Tar solution.

	Cleanup:
	- default mappings changed: /newspirit2 and /cgi-bin2
	
	Features:
	- the object editor has a new popup entry for submitting:
	  "Install (edited external)". Use this method, if you modified
	  the object file with an external editor and want new.spirit
	  to install this file, without saving the content of the
	  object editor.
	- there is a new user preference. The use can decide, if the
	  editor submit popup should not be preselected with any entry,
	  so the user must decide actively, which action should be
	  performed.
	- Link to the CHANGES file on the login page

1.99.7 2001/02/07 joern
	Cleanup:
	- some local perl library path modifications in newspirit.conf
	  are removed by mktardist.pl. I need them on my development system
	  to work with the almost actual CIPP release, without need to
	  install CIPP into my official perl library path.

	Features:
	- 'Project Installation' can now include SQL prod and src files.
	  src files in that way, that a miniminal src tree is built, which
	  can be used on the production system to execute SQL scripts and
	  arbitrary SQL commands (of course, only if you install new.spirit
	  on the production system for this purpose ;). This src tree only
	  includes a base configuration, all database configuration files
	  and SQL objects.

1.99.6 2001/02/01 joern
	Bugfixes:
	- extended base configuration paramters
	  - project root of production system
	- Installation procedure did not copy images to
	  the installation directory
	- session preservation did not always work
	- removed switch for omitting Include processing
	  in 'Project Compilation'. Due to this, Include dependencies
	  were broken
	- create 'logs' directory in 'Project Installation'

	Features:
	- removed the NEWSPIRIT subdirectories. A new 'meta' subdirectory
	  on project root toplevel takes the corresponding files. So the
	  'src' tree ist free of non CVSable files, which makes life
	  much easier
	- object property files reside now in the same directory as the
	  corresponding object file, with '.m' attached to the extension.
	  So adding new files to CVS is easier.
	- CIPP 2.16_01 is mandatory for this new.spirit release
	- final filesystem structure: all files modified by the webserver
	  are now inside the var tree

1.99.5 2001/01/29 joern
	Bugfixes:
	- verbosity of include error output in dependency installation
	  was too high
	- optimized the builtin Perl syntax checker (solves open2
	  resource problem unter Windows NT)

	Features:
	- Project Compilation:
	  - user can decide, whether includes should
	    be processed seperately (for error checking) or not
	  - with or without deletion of the production tree
	- upgraded shipped CIPP distribution to 2.15

1.99.4 2001/01/25 joern
	First release candiate.

	Bugfixes:
	- dependency processing had an esoteric bug. Sometimes dependent
	  objects were not processed
	
	Features:
	- project installation. If you're on a windows box, refer to
	  the release notes.
	- needed Perl modules are bundled with the new.spirit
	  distribution

1.99.2 2000/?/? joern
	Bugfixes:
	- install.pl did not use the determined DB_File module
	  itself. instead the module of our development environment
	  was used
	- cipp-html objects now always depend on the base
	  configuration
	- renamed /icons URL to /i
	  => shorter HTML code
	  => no clashing with Apache standard mapping "/icons"

	Features:
	- project compilation now shows number of objects
	  to process
	- creation of cipp-html objects with .css extension
	  now possible

1.99.1 2000/08/10 joern
	First dimedis internal beta release
	- basic project installation stuff

1.99.0 2000/xx/xx joern
	First internal alpha release, lacks many features, e.g.
	- cvs support
	- project installation
	- generic tool interface
